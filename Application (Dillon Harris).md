Hey,

I really liked your pitch today, I've been wanting to make a game for a long time (ive started a bunch but never actually finished one). I would really like to help you out on this game!
Business
Im fine with just keeping it private for now.
Legal
I think thats a good idea, just keeping it small until there is interest. 

Technical
Looks like you have a really good plan on how you want to move forward with this!
Some technical skills I have:
 - I have some experience with AWS (from cs260, cs240, and cs340). I know Vue.js, and some React.
 - I also have experience with Ruby on Rails, Flask (python based web framework), and Node.js for backend.
 - I also like creating digital art, so if we wanted to use custom assets we could do that too.
 
 I have never used Phaser before, but I would be willing to learn and think I would pick it up quick.

Thanks for considering me.
